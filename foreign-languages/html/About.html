				<h2>Different Us</h2>
				<p>There aren’t other comparable websites. Other sites are what we call ‘yellow pages,’ because they are basically a listings site. There’s a ton of different information out there which makes it really hard to tell the reputable, honest organizations from the fly-by-night programs. That’s why we go right to the source and get you information from people who have been there.<br/>
				Perhaps even more importantly, we care a lot about what we do. We are a small company of 20-and-30-something travelers who come to work every day with the goal of getting more people to go out in the world and have the experiences we had. From teaching in Thailand to volunteering in Tanzania and studying in England, our team has done it all -- and we want you to too.</p>
